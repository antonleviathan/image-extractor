# Script Instructions

## Requirements
* Install nodejs - you can find the download link [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Download this repository using the `Download` button or use `git clone git@github.com:antonleviathan/image-extractor.git` from your terminal to copy it into your curreny directory (check where you are by using `pwd` and `ls`)
* Place jpg files into `selected/` directory
* Place raw files into `raw/` directory
* Open your terminal and `cd` into the script directory (where the `extractSelected.js` file and `selected`, `raw` & `output` are located)
* Run the script while in the directory using `node extractSelection`

* The jpg file names will be matched to raw files and said raw files copied into `output` - voila~
